<p style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">1. Computer Systems and Data Processing</p>
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(a) Mainframe vs Microcomputer (1 mark)</p>

- Mainframe Computer: Large, powerful systems used by organizations for bulk data processing and critical applications.<br>

- Microcomputer: Smaller, personal-use computers like desktops or laptops, designed for individual tasks.<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(b) Data Processing Modes </p>

- Transaction Processing: Real-time processing of individual transactions (e.g., ATM withdrawals).<br>

- Batch Processing: Accumulated data is processed in groups at scheduled times (e.g., payroll systems).<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(c)(i) Properties of a Relation in Databases </p>
- Uniqueness: Each row (tuple) is unique.<br>

- Atomicity: Each cell contains a single value.<br>

- No Ordering: Rows and columns have no inherent order.<br>

- Consistency: All entries in a column are of the same data type.<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(c)(ii) Why Binary is Used in Computers </p>
- Simplicity of Hardware: Binary (0s and 1s) aligns with electrical states (on/off).<br>

- Reliability: Easier to detect and correct errors in binary systems.<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">d) Joseph’s Data Collection Steps </p>
- Define the research objective.<br>

- Identify the target population.<br>

- Choose data collection methods (e.g., surveys, interviews).<br>

- Design data collection tools.<br>

- Collect the data systematically.<br>

- Analyze and interpret the results.<br>


<p style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">2. Database Concepts and Audit</p>
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(a) Composite Key vs Super Key </p>

- Composite Key: A key made of two or more attributes that uniquely identify a record.
- Super Key: Any combination of attributes that uniquely identifies a record, including composite and candidate keys.<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(b) Functions of an Auditor in Database Audit (2 marks)</p>
- Verify Data Integrity: Ensure data is accurate and consistent.<br>

- Review Access Controls: Check who has access and how it's managed.<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(c) Normalization and Variance Formula (Unclear phrasing, but here's a clarification)</p>
- Normalization: Organizing database fields and tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.<br>

- Formula Interpretation:<br>

The expression<br>

S_n = \sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2<br>

represents the sum of squared deviations from the mean, used in calculating variance in statistics.<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(d)(i) Audit Technique Jane Was Using</p>

- RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks): Combines multiple disks to prevent data loss.<br>

- Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS): Maintains power during outages.<br>

- Data Backup: Regularly saving copies of data to restore after failure.<br>


<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">3(b) Database Terms</p>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(i) Transaction:</p>

- A sequence of database operations treated as a single unit, which must be completed fully or not at all.<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(ii) Referential Integrity:</p>

- Ensures relationships between tables remain consistent; for example, a foreign key must match a valid primary key in another table.<br>


<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">3(c) Two Advantages of Direct Data Input</p>

- Accuracy: Reduces human error since data is entered directly from the source.<br>

- Speed: Faster than manual entry, especially with devices like barcode scanners or sensors.<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">(d)(i) Three Functions of an Information System in an Organization</p>


An information system serves multiple roles. Here are three key functions:<br>

- Answer: 10100011.1000₂<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">4(b) Logical vs Physical Data Independence</p>
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Definitions:</p>
- Logical Data Independence:<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Ability to change the logical schema (e.g., adding new fields) without altering the application programs.</p>
- Physical Data Independence:<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Ability to change the physical storage (e.g., indexing, file formats) without affecting the logical schema or applications.</p>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Diagram:<br>

+----------------------------+
|      Application Layer    |<br>

+----------------------------+
|   Logical Schema (Tables) |<br>

+----------------------------+
| Physical Storage (Files)  |<br>

+----------------------------+


<p style="color: white; font-size: 24px;">🔹 Logical independence protects user views; physical independence protects storage changes.</p>
